    Then he understands.
</h3>
<h3 style="color: white;">
The monsters can’t hurt him. They left him alone because the hell he’s stuck in is already everything he has ever feared. He already wants to die. They have no effect on him.
</h3>
<h3 style="color: red;">
He’s already been dead for a long, long time and he hadn’t even realised.
</h3>
<h3 style="color: white;">
Where he’s standing used to be a nature trail of some sort. The cliff overlooks a forest that had once been filled with all kinds of animals and people who used to come here to visit. He actually thinks maybe he came here once. A long time ago with his parents when they had been visiting Seoul. Maybe not though. He doesn’t remember.
The terrain is rough and jagged. Now, Bobby doesn’t blame Jisung for tripping. He’s surprised he didn’t.
Sure enough, there is a cliff edge in front of him. It’s not the tallest he’s ever seen but looking down it’s certainly enough to kill him.
</h3>
<h3 style="color: red;">
So it’s decided.

<h3 style="color: white;">
With the blindfold clutched tightly in his fist, Bobby Radcliff takes one last deep breath of air that doesn’t even smell like it belongs to his planet anymore, and then he closes his eyes, however redundant that may be, and steps backwards off the ledge, allowing the ground to slip away from his feet, gasping as he falls.
He had done his very best to remember his members as they were, instead of what the world made them into.

<h3 style="color: purple;">
Chris Jackson wasn’t a bloody mess of flesh and bone on the side of the road. He was fierce and brave and protective and kind and his eyes twinkled when he smiled and he would never ever abandon you or let you stop fighting. He was the best friend anyone could have ever asked for. No one had been better than him. He had made Bobby feel so safe.
</h3>
<h3 style="color: green;">
Sam Rivers wasn’t just another victim of naivete, left in a pool of his own blood in some stranger's house in a random place in America. He was the most affectionate boy you’d ever meet and gave the best hugs in the world and had a laugh so beautiful and pure and alive that it could lift your mood whenever you heard it, no matter how sad you were.
</h3>
<h3 style="color: blue;">
Sky Marsh was not a blue-lipped corpse, left to rot on a random forest floor. He was eccentric and incredibly intelligent and full of unique quirks and he was kind of weird and he made strange noises and he relentlessly annoyed Bobby every day and Bobby adored every single second of it and would give anything in the world to experience it one last time.
</h3>
<h3 style="color: white;">
What about him? Did he make any difference? Did his existence matter to anyone? Bobby likes to think so but he’ll never know for sure. Everyone likes to think they’ve left some sort of impact, but how many people really do? He was so young too. How much could he have really done?
</h3>
<h3 style="color: white;">
None of that matters to Bobby Radcliff now though. He doesn’t care about anything anymore. He doesn’t feel anything. He doesn’t have to suffer anymore. The monsters can’t hurt him now.
Maybe that means that they had won, but Bobby hit the ground a few minutes ago and they have already moved onto their next victims. He doesn’t care and neither do they.
