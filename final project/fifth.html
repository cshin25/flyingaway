  Bobby hauls his aching body off the grass. The ground scrapes his knees as he stands up, his bones aching with exhaustion. He’s sure by now that the dirt and blood has been permanently tattooed on his skin. He can feel the last remnants of the sun dying away in the sky. This is it.
He initially hadn’t wanted to take off his blindfold. It was from Sky. It was the last thing Bobby would ever have left of him. Before he had died, Sky had made him promise to never take it off and Bobby had wanted to keep that promise but what’s the point now? It’s not gonna make Sky any less dead.
The idea of looking at a world that no longer had his friends in it wasn’t a world Bobby ever really wanted to see, but if it would kill him, then who cares?
Perhaps curiosity has just gotten the better of him. Perhaps he wants to know what he would see. He can’t imagine anything more horrific than what he has already witnessed.
</h3>
<h3 style="color: white;">
He grips the back of the dirty blindfold with his blood stained hands, drawing in a deep shaking breath where the air doesn’t quite reach his lungs and, with his eyes firmly screwed shut, he pulls the blindfold off.
Immediately the light attacks his eyes, trying to burn his sockets. It’s been so long since he’s properly seen sunlight that it’s like he’s developed an allergy towards it. He can feel the wind rushing around him the whispers of his dead members screaming in his ears. Everything from the second since Chris died has led to this. Every death.
It was always inevitable, whether he wanted to admit it or not. How could you ever live in a world like this and be happy? All the love has died in Bobby’s life, all possibility of happiness, all warmth, all light, all meaning. That’s why he has to look.
He opens his eyes.
</h3>
<h3 style="color: red;">
It all falls silent.
</h3>
<h3 style="color: red;">
Shouldn’t he be dead by now? Isn’t that how it works? Why isn’t he dead?
</h3>
<h3 style="color: red;">
He can’t see a thing. It’s too bright.
</h3>
<h3 style="color: red;">
It takes a good few seconds for his eyes to adjust to the light and he doesn’t understand. Why isn’t he dead?
That’s all he wanted. He wants to join his friends so why isn’t it working? What was he supposed to see? He thought he was supposed to see something that terrified him, so where is it?
The sun casts a haunting orange glow over the ground and hurts Bobby’s skin. Everything seems dull. The color has been drained from the entire world.
</h3>
<h3 style="color: red;">
The monsters are silent. Everything is silent. He’s alone.
