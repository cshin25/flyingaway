  <p id="myParagraph">The grass doesn’t feel the same anymore. Bobby runs his fingers through the blades, unsure of what exact shade of green they are. They feel wrong.

    Everything feels wrong as he lies in that damp place, his legs and his heart both having completely given up after mindlessly walking for what felt like days, but was probably a much shorter amount of time.
    The birds are silent now. Everything’s silent. His friends are all gone. He’s the only one left.
    Bobby remembers it all far too clearly. It has been seared permanently into his worn out brain, but he isn’t sure how long ago it was. It could’ve been a month, it could’ve been two days. Time stops mattering when you have nowhere to go and no one to see. It isn’t a surprise that he remembers everything because it has all been so recent, but even so, its like his memories have become HD and he remembers details he normally would never have noticed, and at the same time, he remembers only vague blurs. He simultaneously remembers everything and nothing.
    Its sunny today, much like it had been on the first day of the end. He knows because he feels it burning his skin and can see it shining through his blindfold, despite the fact that his eyes are closed. He knows he’s near a cliff edge, but other than that, he’s completely lost. The ‘wind’ is strangely quiet right now. Maybe it knows by now that it’s pointless to even try and get to him. He’s already too far gone.
