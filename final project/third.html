<h3 style="color: white;">There was something so strikingly different about how Sam died.
Bobby wonders if it was because it was the most violent or possibly because it so drastically contrasted who Sam had been as a person.
The boy had been so soft and gentle, and the way he died was just...
Bobby has so many thoughts racing around his head already, and he just can’t latch onto words that quite describe how Sam died, or how he felt about it.
</h3>
<h3 style="color: white;">
Unspeakable came closest, and unspeakable had been a word Bobby knew well by this point. He hasn’t uttered a word since Chris.
When it came to Chris, Bobby had managed to partially suppress that particular scar because it had all happened so fast, and from where he was standing, he saw blood, and heard that bone-cracking smack that had occurred when he hit the truck, but the maknae hadn’t gotten a good look at the body, so on some level, his brain is able to deny that it even happened.
</h3>

<h3 style="color: white;">Sky had been doing so well as their newest edition of leader too.
As they navigated their way through the outdoors blindly, holding onto each other desperately, Sky kept an especially tight hold onto Sam, because the former might just slip away or wander off if he didn’t. Bobby, being blindfolded of course, could only tell because he was behind Sky and every so often, the older boy would lurch forwards to keep a hold on Sam, who was in front of him.
Sam wasn’t really responsive anymore. Bobby is still surprised they didn’t have to carry him.
By some miracle, Sky managed to get them all to safety, although safety is a relative term at this point.
It probably helped that everyone was dead silent.
</h3>
<h3 style="color: white;">Sam was like a marionette whose strings had been cut. He’d move if someone made him, but he didn’t respond to them. Sky tried so hard to get him to eat or drink something, anything, but it was as if he was just gone. Like he was already dead.
Bobby only ate because the latter asked him too. He saw how delirious the now-oldest boy was. He would continually pace around the house they were in, double checking absolutely every single window was completely covered. If Bobby could take at least one thing off his mind, maybe it would’ve been of some help. He still doesn’t know, but he doubts it helped Sam at all, considering what followed.
It all went as well as it possibly could’ve until the sun began to set and the room they all were in got gradually darker. They all sat together, the silence swallowing them.
</h3>
<h3 style="color: white;">Sky had found a knife. It hadn’t scared Bobby as much as it should’ve, but Sam looked like he didn’t like it one bit. No one else really reacted. He’d told them it was just in case anything happened and they needed to defend themselves. Maybe it cast the fleeting illusion that they could be safe, but if that was the case, no one but Sky believed it.
  <h3 style="color: red;">
The knife lay on a close by table.
</h3>
<h3 style="color: white;">
Bobby felt sleep creeping up on him too. He’d moved so he was sitting Sky.
Sam had apparently tired himself out. This was the one and only time Bobby had seen him sleep. His head had fallen against Sky's shoulder.
It always irritated him back then, how they would both bother him, but now as he lies under a dying sky, listening to wind that whispers for him to remove his blindfold and open his eyes, completely alone in the world, he wishes he’d appreciated it more.
</h3>
<h3 style="color: white;">The silence in that awful house had continued to eat away at every single one of them, until a loud bang cut right through it. Everyone jolted awake, terror flooding through them all once more, now a familiar feeling.
Sky’s grip on Bobby’s hand tightened significantly.
More banging. Someone was trying to get in. Bobby can remember the pleading cries for help coming from outside, but he can’t remember what the voice sounded like.
What happened next happened quicker than Bobby can ever describe. Sam opened his eyes and sat up. He looked alert, like he was aware of his surroundings finally. They all looked at him in shock. Bobby noticed Sky’s other hand trying to reach out for him, but all of a sudden, Sam stood up and walked out of the room, as if being called. Sky immediately leapt up and followed after him. Bobby remembers following them.
Sky whispered urgently for Sam to come back, because he’d started towards the door where the noise was coming from.
</h3>
<h3 style="color: white;">
Someone was out there, and they needed help. That much is still clear. Opening it wasn’t an option.
Sam finally spoke and it was like he was in a trance. He’d looked right at the door and said that it might be Chris. He’d promised to catch up with them, after all, hadn’t he? They couldn’t leave him out there. He’d promised to find them. Sam sounded so sure of himself.
</h3>
<h3 style="color: white;">
Sky grabbed Sam and tried to drag him back, but Sam has always been stronger than he looked. He repeated over and over that it was Chris at the door and they couldn’t let him die, and his voice cracked when he said it, as if he was close to tears and the only thing that would calm him was letting that person in from outside.
Sam bent down and peered through the peephole of the door that had been visible through the stacked furniture Sky had used as a barricade, and Bobby remembers the feeling of devastation and defeat that washed over them all. Sam was dead from that moment.
When he turned around with the same dead look in his eye that Chris had, the oldest boy knew he’d failed them all.
</h3>
<h3 style="color: white;">
There was a bubble of silence, a moment in time, where Sam stared straight at Sky, the older boy cowering in terror.
Then it all sped up and Sam darted forward, grabbing onto Sky’s arm. Sky tried to fight back, but he couldn’t stop Sam from impaling himself through the neck with the knife he was still holding, that was supposed to protect them.
</h3>
<h3 style="color: red;">
The ringing in Bobby’s ears came back as his heart raced too fast for his body to keep up. The chilling, guttural, shuddering, gasping noises that came out of Sam still echo around Bobby’s head. If you’ve never heard it, there’s no way to describe it but it’s unmistakably the sound of death. The air could no longer get to his lungs, which were filling with blood now instead.
Sky caught Sam when he fell backwards, blood spraying all over him. He watched the life drain from the dancer and onto the floor. They all did.
</h3>
<h3 style="color: white;">
Bobby remembers Sky's hands around Sam’s throat, as if somehow he would be able to reverse what Sam had done to himself. As if he might be able to stop the bleeding.
<h3 style="color: red;">
There was nothing they could do. It was a terrified, desperate, final attempt to save someone he loved.
Sam very quickly fell limp, eyes empty and glassy, in Sky’s arms, in a sea of red, leaving what was left of the boys as nothing more than spectators.
</h3>
<h3 style="color: white;">
Bobby blacked out after that. His body simply shut down. He never asked anyone what happened while he was out, because he couldn’t and he also didn’t want to.
People who didn’t get the chance to know Sam Rivers didn’t really experience life, Bobby thinks. Nobody laughed louder than Sam. Nobody smiled brighter. Nobody loved deeper. He was like pure love personified and anyone who was around him couldn’t help but fall for him, even a little.
Bobby closes his eyes under his blindfold, trying to remember what it felt like to have Sam’s comforting arms around him.
</h3>
<h2 style="color: black;">He can’t. The feeling is gone.
