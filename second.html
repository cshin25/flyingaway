  Chris had been the first to go. Bobby reckons that was when he truly stopped living too. Chris had been everything to him. He’d meant everything to them all. Without him, the rest were none. Without him, they really were just lost kids. He had given them purpose and a home.

Aside from reports of mass suicides in other countries and people on the street appearing, understandably, much more on edge than normal and there being an worryingly high amount of abandoned houses and driveways, Bobby can’t recall anything particularly out of the ordinary.
<h3 style="color: white;">
The traffic on the road had been much busier and more frantic too, but that was a detail Bobby would only remember after the events that followed.

Bobby had walked alongside Sky and Sam, all on their way to hang out that day, with Chris leading the way.

It had all been relatively fine until Chris’s phone had to ring and he stopped walking and froze to the spot once he’d answered it.</h3>
</h3>

<h3 style="color: white;">Sam seemed concerned as Chris’s gaze had fallen to the ground, and Bobby, having passed them by now, paused and looked back. He only heard the odd word, and the names Lucas and Johnny were mentioned, and Chris’s eyes had glazed over with tears.
  Perhaps his family had been the latest victims of the mass suicides. Bobby would never know.
</h3>
  <h3 style="color: white;">
Chris then choked up and turned away to face the road, a decision he would not live to regret, but Bobby most definitely would, because his gaze left Chris’s face and returned to the remaining friends.

They left Chris by himself on that street, walking together for a few brief moments, but Bobby looked back just to make sure Chris was following and that he was okay and that’s when everything ended.

The sky seemed to darken and distant screams filled the air and Bobby heard something explode. It all happened at once, like a switch had been flipped and the world he had known was gone.</h3>


</h3>
<h3 style="color: white;">Chris was not following them. He was standing in the same spot but he wasn’t crying anymore. His eyes were fixed on the darkening sky above the buildings on the adjacent street, but when Sam called his name and he turned to face them, those were not his eyes. Something had clicked in Bobby’s brain and he knew somehow that Chris was gone. Chris’s eyes had been brown, and so warm and beautiful and they’d made Bobby feel so safe.

The screams only got louder and the sky darker in the space of a few seconds and Bobby began to smell fire.
<h3 style="color: white;">

The sun was gone and the wind seemed to be calling to him, although he’d come to learn that that was most definitely not wind.

The screams of Bobby’s friends filled his ears just as Chris stepped backwards into the street before any of them could stop him, not that they would’ve been able to.

There was a screech of breaks, screams that echoed down the street and right into Bobby’s bones, a crash and a horrifying noise that words couldn’t describe but it was the sound that a human being makes when they hit a fast moving truck.</h3>
</h3>
<h3 style="color: red;">Blood had gone everywhere and Bobby could hear his own heartbeat ringing in his ears and Chris was gone from this earth in a second. Their brave, wonderful, kind, funny, smart, compassionate leader. Everything that Chris was, everything that he could’ve grown to be, all the love and music and light he’d yet to shine on the world was wiped out in a single second. In one moment, he was alive and so full of hope and optimism and unrivalled ambition, and the next he was a mess of blood and mangled limbs on the street.
</h3>
<h3 style="color: white;">

Bobby didn’t know what happened after that. He just shut down and everything blurred together and someone grabbed him and carried him away before Chris’s body was even cold and before the light had even completely left his eyes.

Maybe his body couldn’t handle it, and maybe he just passed out from shock, because the next thing he knew, he was surrounded by his members in a house he didn’t recognise.

Sam had fallen into a catatonic state and wouldn’t respond to anyone. His eyes simply glazed over and looked straight ahead. He lost himself along with Chris on that road.

Meanwhile Sky poured everything he had into taking care of him. Anything to distract from whatever had just happened. Sky had been good at taking care of them. Bobby had always found it hard to read Sky, and he wasn’t in the best frame of mind so he couldn’t see what his emotions were but they couldn’t have been much different from his own.
</h3>




<h3 style="color: white;">Chris’s name was only mentioned once after that, and that was a much fresher memory Bobby wishes he could forget because it haunts him, but that didn’t come till much later.

Bobby never tried to grieved Chris’s death, mostly due to the fact that he didn’t get enough time, but also because he simply ignored it. It hadn’t happened. The world, however cruel and unfair it may have been before it ended, did not get to decide to blow out the bright flame that was Chris Jackson. It didn’t have the right. The world really did end that day, because there was no world worth living in that could discard their wonderful leader as if he was nothing. Bobby owed Chris everything and loved him so much that words could not fully describe just how much he loved him. They all did. Anyone who had ever met Chris, even for the briefest of moments, did. You simply didn’t not love Christopher Jackson and everything that he stood for. It was impossible.
</h3>
<h3 style="color: white;">

Chris had been the rope, Bobby reckons. He was the rope that tied them together and kept them safe, and that rope had snapped. Maybe if Chris hadn’t died first, they could’ve stayed alive a little longer. Maybe the events that would follow would have played out differently.
