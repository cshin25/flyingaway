<h3 style="color: white;">The sun is still setting and the sky is orange now. The day is dying and it’s still so sunny, but what for? Sunshine symbolized happiness and that was no longer something that existed.
That had been Sky’s nickname too. Sunshine.
Bobby wonders why Sky even still tried.He knew the second Sam died, that they would both be dead soon too.
Bobby doesn’t have it within him to cry. When the first death happened, he was too shocked for the tears to come. By now, he’s been so brutally beaten by the world that his tear ducts no longer worked.
</h3>
<h3 style="color: white;">

What was Sky still fighting for? What did he have to live for? Bobby doesn’t know because he didn’t ask.
They got separated. Of course they got separated. Sky was pleading with Bobby to never ever let go of his hand. Bobby suspects the older boy meant that in more ways than just literal. Sky could appear like he held himself together pretty well, but he was still an eighteen year old boy. He was only a kid and a mere few months older than Bobby was himself.
</h3>
<h3 style="color: white;"> The noises that had been following them since all this began started creeping again, faster and louder than before and the two boys had just panicked. Bobby had been convinced he’d wanted to die, but the biological impulse in his brain that screamed at him to survive kicked in and he let go of Sky.
The next time he saw his friend, he wishes more than anything that he could erase the image from his mind.
He’d begun wandering around aimlessly. Well, not quite aimlessly. His intention had been to find Sky but he knew in his heart that was a fruitless task.
</h3>
<h3 style="color: white;">
He tripped.
</h3>
<h3 style="color: white;">

Of course he tripped. He tripped over what had to be a tree root and the edge of his blindfold came up and it was absolutely not a tree root.
 The hollow void in Bobby’s chest where he used to feel things before the world destroyed him twanged with what must’ve been pain when he saw what he tripped over.
</h3>
<h3 style="color: white;">

People never paid attention to Sky. It seemed like no matter how hard they both worked to get recognised, they just weren’t.

The hollow void in Bobby’s chest where he used to feel things before the world destroyed him twanged with what must’ve been pain when he saw what he tripped over.
</h3>
<h3 style= "color: red;">However Sky had died, it had been agonising and slow and he’d been completely alone. He was so young and he’d obviously been terrified of dying all by himself so that’s precisely what had happened to him.
  </h3>
  <h3 style="color: white;">
There had been something undeniably innocent about Sky. His eyes had once glittered with childish mischief whenever he annoyed the others and at other times shone with excitement and optimism. He might’ve been one of the most innocent of them all, and no one seemed to realise that.
Sky’s eyes were glassy and empty and he was so incredibly pale his skin was basically grey and it looked as if the older boy had died of blood loss right in that spot after dragging himself around for as long as he could.
</h3>
<h3 style="color: white;">
Blood stained and trickled from his mouth and darkened the surrounding earth.
Sky hadn’t wanted to die. He hadn’t wanted this. He was the only one of them who hadn’t.
Bobby despised himself for not feeling anything except for the dull pain in his heart. This was Sky, one of his most precious friends. He’d been close with them all, but there was no denying that he, Sky and Sam had been just a little bit closer and the amount the two older boys had loved each other had only heightened how much they loved him. This should hurt far more, shouldn’t it?
</h3>
<h3 style= "color: white;">
Make no mistake. Bobby loves Sky so much it actually hurts and it would take a little more than them both being dead to change that. He just doesn’t want to feel anything anymore and his brain appears to have almost completely turned off his emotions. He just wants it to be over.
Bobby knows that he had been Sky’s last tie to Sam. He also knows that’s obviously not why Sky had wanted to keep him so close by. He knows how deeply Sky had loved him. They were brothers. However, he understands that he reminds Sky of Sam in some ways, mainly due to how close they had been, and that the older boy can’t allow the last reminder of someone so important to him to just fade away just as Sam himself had.
</h3>
<h3 style="color: white;">

Sky was rarely given any credit for everything he did. No one would have expected him to last this long. Bobby, before, could’ve gone on about it for days, but it didn’t matter how many ways he phrased the same frustrations.
It’s not like it matters anymore. Sky is dead and it seems like the rest of the world is too. If there really is another universe out there, one free from monsters where they all stayed together, Bobby hopes that they all get the love they deserve and he hopes they get to live the long, happy lives that were stolen from him and his friends in this world.
</h3>
<h3 style= "color: white;">
He’s all alone now. They’re finally all gone. He’d outlived them all. Why him? Why had he been chosen as the onlooker to the deaths of all his friends? The universe had reduced him to being a spectator.
It’s still sunny, but the sun is finally setting now and his real sunshine died about half an hour ago and everyone else is gone, which means it’s Bobby’s turn to look.
</h3>
<h1 style= "color: red;">
Time is up.
